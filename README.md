prepros_starter_kit
====================

Starter kit for new projects and/or prototypes.

It's a good starting point for building a static html or first stage of build.

LESS
app.less @imports a bunch of less files adapted from html5boilerplate (incl. normalize), plus elements (http://lesselements.com)

JACASCRIPT
Structure based on an article from .net magazine, by Mike Byrne. Use data-behavior to attach code to DOM nodes (Jquery expected ... I might make another version without some time).
Includes CustomEvents, Resize and ViewportOrientation. All js files are concatenated by prepros app (http://alphapixels.com/prepros/).
